Trying to understand GitHub as someone that knows fuck-all about code

I should begin my story by revealing the fact that the biggest exposure I’ve had to any form of code was the html on my myspace page. (And I thought I was the bomb!). 
Unfortunately my relationship with the programming world has from then on remained on my “would-hook-up-with-but-takes-too-much-graft” list, working on the fringes of it while marketing different tools and programs. While many of my co-workers ranted and raved about the collaborative working abilities of GitHub, I passed it off as techno mumbo gumbo that I shouldn’t worry my pretty little head about.
